- Upload Doc ( Extract text )
- Create embeddings using open ai
- store it in vector database ( If doc of ssame name shoukd be able to clear the old embedding and store the new one)

- APi for uploading doc
- API for q and a on doc




_ Weaviate
- Vector dimension - Itâ€™s the length of the vector (i.e. number of values in the embedding array) produced by your embedding model for each text chunk.


If user uploads file user need to be informed about the process and failure


Need to add tessaract in docker
need to add tokenizer in docker

# Improvement
- Embedding and api can be separated this will make api server faster
